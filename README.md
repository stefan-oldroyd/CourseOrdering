# CourseOrdering
A simple course ordering/ prerequisite algorythmic challenge


* Write a program that, given a list of courses and their pre-requisites, 
* produce a possible order in which a student can complete as many of the provided course units as possible, 
* adhering to the pre-requisite requirements.
             
The program reads from two input files, “courses.csv” and “prerequisites.csv”, 
which can be found in SampleInputFiles/ folder.
